Welcome to my webpage! Here you will find a summary of my academic profile, news and selected publications. For detailed information about my lab, opportunities, publications etc, visit the separate pages.

### Summary 
I am a Assistant Professor (Lecturer) in Computer Science and part of the Cybersecurity Group,
at the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/informatics) at King's College London (KCL). Prior to joining King's in December 2021, I was an tenured research fellow (2017-2021) and prior to that a postdoc, both at Newcastle University, UK.

I care deeply about privacy, security & digital safety for social good, that enables and betters people's lives - across their diverse, rich and colourful experiences. My research is therefore at the intersection of privacy, security, human-computer interaction and social science, and specifically address the following themes: 



My research is at the intersection of privacy, security and human-computer interaction (and AI in collaborative projects). I employ evidence-based methods, with a track record of qualitative, quantitative, experimental and social science computational methods, to investigate the human's perceptions, attitudes and experiences including interactional and emotional aspects of privacy, security and AI. 

I am particularly interested in technology (-facilitated, -use) disparities in vulnerable and marginalised communities that lead to unequal real life and societal outcomes. I further seek to develop accessible/inclusive solutions for safe and equitable online experiences, while working with technology, policy and community stakeholders. My current research topics can be summarised under:
