### Project 1: Inclusive Privacy & Security
Privacy, security, digital safety are often designed for majority or WEIRD populations, thereby not appropriately serving all user communities (minority, with specific needs, or life situations), and risk discriminating access and appropriate engagement, while also creating concerns for them. The PhD project will focus on a (type of) privacy, security or digital safety context and seek better privacy/security design with and for these at-risk communities, such as addressing
  * Privacy for women and queer communities for e.g. in online platforms
  * Authentication for the visually impaired 
  * Digital safety for socio-economically deprived communities (where privacy/security is often traded-off for more pressing life needs)
  * Privacy and digital safety programmes for adult digital starters (often from deprived or minority populations, or experiencing the digital generational divide)
  * Privacy and security of refugees and migrants 

The proposed PhD projects will seek better privacy/security design with and for these communities. It will involve a mix of qualitative, participatory research and community-centred research. The projects will involve working with stakeholders such as charities, NGOs that support vulnerable and marginalised groups and victim-survivors, as well as digital safety advocacy.
